          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <P>'Blood Bank India' is the first product resulted out of the community
             welfare initiative called 'People Project' from uSiS Technologies. Universally, 
             'Blood' is recognized as the most precious element that sustains life. It saves 
             umerable lives across the world in a variety of conditions. Once in 
             every 2- seconds, someone, somewhere is desperately in need of blood. More than 
             29 million units of blood components are transfused every year. The need for 
             blood is great - on any given day, approximately 39,000 units of
              Red Blood Cells are needed. Each year, we could
               meet only up to 1% (approx) of our nationâ€™s 
            demand for blood transfusion.</P>
         
         <p>Despite the increase in the number of donors, blood remains in short supply 
           during emergencies, mainly attributed to the lack of information and accessibility. 
           We positively believe this tool can overcome most of these challenges by 
           effectively connecting the blood donors with the blood recipients</p>
